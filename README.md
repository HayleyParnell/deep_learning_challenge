# Overview of the Analysis:

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, Iâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

# Results:

## Data Preprocessing:

Target Variable(s): The target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL," which indicates whether the organization's funding application was successful or not. 

Beneficial ID Columns used: "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," "CLASSIFICATION," "USE_CASE," "ORGANIZATION," "STATUS," "INCOME_AMT," and "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS."

Non-Beneficial ID Columns Removed:"EIN" and "NAME" 


## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

Using my knowledge of TensorFlow, I designed a deep learning model, with three layers: one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.The input layer has neurons equal to the number of input features. The first hidden layer has 80 neurons and uses the RelU activation function. The second hidden layer has 30 neaurons and uses the RelU activation function. The output layer has a single neruon becuase it's a binary classification problem. 

## Summary:

In summary, the deep learning model demonstrated moderate success in predicting the success of funding applications for Alphabet Soup. While the model achieved reasonable accuracy, there may be opportunities to further improve its performance. 

## Recommendation:

A different model, such as a Random Forest classifier, could offer an alternative solution to the classification problem. Random Forests are known for their ability to handle high-dimensional data with categorical features and can provide accurate predictions while being less prone to overfitting compared to deep learning models. Therefore, considering the nature of the dataset and the need for interpretable results, a Random Forest classifier could be a suitable alternative for this classification problem.
